# Attitude and Orbital Determination 

Head of AODS: Emmanuel Airiofolo

## Work Summary
This feasibility design study attempts to provide a useful reference for the Attitude and
Orbit Determination System (AODS) for a rotating space habitat design that advance the
ability of humans to live in space for long periods of time. The Nexus design concept is
developed with the principal aim of addressing the problems in long term space exploration:
artificial gravity, radiation and shielding protection, sustainable food, structural design and
commercial values.
This paper covers station operating conditions for maximising crew comfort, where a
station spin rate of 2 Revolutions per minute (rpm) resulted in a station radius of 223 m.
The gravity gradient and coriolis forces are optimised under these conditions in maximising
the crew comfort during their missions. The design of principal categories of the orbital
and attitude conditions, station keeping and electric propulsion approaches are presented
with a focus on establishing useful sources in the literature, as well as useful calculations
and simulation of data. The overarching theme of the paper is to show the feasibility of the
Nexus station design to combat a fundamental problem of space exploration.
